### OVERVIEW:
SortViz is a web application that allows for the visualization of several common sorting algorithms using a bar graph array. The user may generate new arrays with random values, or select algorithms to apply to the current array. Animations depicting the selected algorithm's comparisons and value swapping for the array are visually shown in the window, and will result in a sorted bar graph. This application was created using JavaScript, React, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Visual Studio Code.

### GETTING STARTED:
First, navigate to: https://dreweiswerth.github.io/SortViz/ \
There, the user may generate a new bar graph array by clicking the "New Array" button, or can apply a
sorting algorithms to the current array by clicking one of the buttons labeled "Selection", "Insertion", "Quick", "Heap", or "Merge". Animations depicting the selected algorithm's comparisons and value
swapping for the array are visually shown in the window, and will result in a sorted bar graph. Once the sorting animations have completed, the user may click the "New Array" button to generate a new array and test other algorithms.
