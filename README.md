### OVERVIEW:
This web application allows for the visualization of several common sorting algorithms using a bar graph.
It was initially generate using Node.js and the "create-react-app" package, and then designed using 
Javascript, React, HTML, and CSS.

### GETTING STARTED:
First, navigate to the website: https://dreweiswerth.github.io/SortViz/ \
There, the user may generate a new bar graph array by clicking the "New Array" button, or can see the
sorting algorithms applied to the current bar graph by clicking one of the buttons labeled
"Selection", "Insertion", "Quick", "Heap", or "Merge". Once the sorting animations have completed,
the user may click the "New Array" button to generate a new array and test other algorithms.
