### OVERVIEW:
This web application allows for the visualization of several common sorting algorithms using a bar graph.
It was initially generate using Node.js and the "create-react-app" package, and then designed using 
Javascript, React, HTML, and CSS.

### GETTING STARTED:
First, navigate to: https://dreweiswerth.github.io/SortViz/ \
There, the user may generate a new bar graph array by clicking the "New Array" button, or can apply a
sorting algorithms to the current array by clicking one of the buttons labeled "Selection", "Insertion", "Quick", "Heap", or "Merge". Animations depicting the selected algorithm's comparisons and value
swapping for the array are visually shown in the window, and will result in a sorted bar graph. Once the sorting animations have completed, the user may click the "New Array" button to generate a new array and test other algorithms.
